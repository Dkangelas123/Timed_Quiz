# Timed_Quiz
On this program I implement time intervals, local storage and event liseners. this is a quiz thats is able to save the scores of the players.
It comes with a times that everytime you get the answer wrong it will decrease by 10 the score is related to the timer so the higher the time higher the score. 
the scors will stay at the page saved for future usage or can be deleted by the user on any time.
